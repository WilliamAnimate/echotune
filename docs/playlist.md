# Setting up your echotune playlist

The echotune playlist "language" is possibly the most simple thing to ever exist. To add the file located at `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/music/Portal Stories Mel Soundtrack/31 - Time and Time Again.mp3` to your playlist, you simply add `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/music/Portal Stories Mel Soundtrack/31 - Time and Time Again.mp3` into your playlist file.

## Example

```
// comments are possible, but pretty useless. it is supported for documentation purposes like this though.
/home/nyan/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/music/OneShot OST/Nightmargin (Casey Gu), ft Eliza Velasquez and Michael Shirt - OneShot Soundtrack - 01 My Burden Is Light.mp3
// a `~` gets expanded to your home directory. this may not work if your user profile contains
// non-utf8 characters.
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/music/OneShot OST/Nightmargin (Casey Gu), ft Eliza Velasquez and Michael Shirt - OneShot Soundtrack - 02 Someplace I Know.mp3
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/music/OneShot OST/Nightmargin (Casey Gu), ft Eliza Velasquez and Michael Shirt - OneShot Soundtrack - 03 Puzzle Solved.mp3
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/music/OneShot OST/Nightmargin (Casey Gu), ft Eliza Velasquez and Michael Shirt - OneShot Soundtrack - 04 Phosphor.mp3
```
